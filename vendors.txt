How does HTTP/2 actually implement framing and frame multiplexing, and why is this possible at all?
An HTTP/1.1 request is composed of a request line, then a headers section, followed by a data section. 
The start line ends with a carriage return and linefeed (CRLF), and so does each header field. i
The headers section is then concluded with two CRLFs (an empty line) signaling the start of the data section.
HTTP/2, on the other hand, implements a binary framing format, where the HTTP mes- sage is split into frames composed of sequences of bytes. 
Each frame contains headers (not the HTTP headers) that contain the frame metadata, such as the frame length, type, and stream ID, in addition to the frame payload. 
The frame format is illustrated in Figure 8-13.
